First of all, thank you for the opportunity and I hope you are satisfied with my assignment.

I used the Laravel framwork with boostrap and JQuery library like it was advised. 

I followed the MVC structure and used multiple controllers, views and models to represent the RDB.

I enjoy object-oriented programming more than front-end development, so I focused on the models and making sure I used all the ressouces and tools Laravel gives me to build a RDB that works flawlessla and can easily be modified and extended while following the norms of PHP and Laravel development. That being said, I am eager to learn more front-end development tools and improve my skills so that I can produce websites with beautiful frontent.

The website I did will let a user upload a .csv file. That file is stored locally then parsed into a collection of objects and saved it into a RDB. While saving into the RDB the website will check if the category, condition and tax region are already stored in the database otherwise it will insert them in their own table and link them to the lot.
The website also offers to the user the ability to manually create, edit and delete lots, categories and conditions with a basic user interface.

I used a MySQL database to store the data in a RDB, you will need to edit the .env file with the credential of your own DB. The database contains 4 tables: "lots", "categories", "conditions", "taxe_regions"
